# Welcome

This is a landing page for custom code used in the manuscript [Unstable neurons underlie a stable behavior](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4405) publised in Nature Neuroscience, October 2016.

### Time frequency contours

Multiple figures use a method for high-resolution time-frequency analysis developed in the Gardner lab called the auditory contour transform (described in [Stable time-frequency contours for sparse signal representation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6811462/)).  The latest version of this code can be found at [https://github.com/jmarkow/acontour](https://github.com/jmarkow/acontour).  

### Spectrograms and song alignments

Code that was used for generating spectrograms and performing song alignments (first described in [The Song Must Go On:  Resilience of the Songbird Vocal Motor Pathway](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038173)) can be found at [https://github.com/jmarkow/zftftb](https://github.com/jmarkow/zftftb).

### Spike sorting

Spike sorting was performed using algorithms described in [Mesoscopic Patterns of Neural Activity Support Songbird Cortical Sequences](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002158).  The repository with the latest version of this code can be found at [https://github.com/jmarkow/spikoclust](https://github.com/jmarkow/spikoclust).

### Miniscope-related materials

Acquisition and analysis software related to the custom miniscope can be found here [https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/).
